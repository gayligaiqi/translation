I have been an avid reader my entire life, and I have a variety of book preferences in different subjects, fiction and non-fiction alike. However, in adult years, people usually let this passion of theirs fade away into oblivion, instead devoting their time to other endeavours. It is no surprise that few adults read on a regular basis, regardless of book format (we’re counting e-books and audio-books as well!). But I am not going to write about the impact of social media on our attention span, nor am I going to judge from my nerdy high horse. I will, however, try to convince you that in our profession it is necessary for people to read. A lot. I also have some book recommendations for programmers out there, and I hope you’ll give them a shot.

生活中我是一个嗜书如命的人，不管是小说还是非小说，不同种类的书我都有那么几本。不过，人在成年之后，读书的热情会逐渐消退，而把精力投入到别的事情上。令人毫不奇怪的是，不论任何形式的书（电子书和有声读物也算在内），成年人都很少定期阅读。我并不打算谈论社交媒体对注意力的影响，也不打算站在道德高地批判一番。我只想让你相信大量阅读对一个人的职业生涯至关重要。下面是我给推荐给程序员的一些书，希望你能试着读一读。

Here at Algotech Solutions we have recently started to invest in our very own library of (mostly) technical books. Some of these books have been a godsend for us, since we expanded our horizons in a very exciting fashion. Each book contributes in its own way to our development, and I believe that a good programmer must be well read in the following topics:

我们最近在Algotech Solutions投资建设了图书馆，其中大量都是技术书籍。有些书简直就是上帝的恩赐，通过它们，我们极大的拓展了视野。每本书都对开发有所助益，我认为优秀的程序员要需要认真阅读以下几个主题：

Biographies for programmers
给程序员的传记

Biographies and, of course, autobiographies can be a great source of inspiration for professional programmers, especially for those having the ambition to innovate. One of the most important features of human kind is that they do not need to re-live the same stories over and over again. They can analyse others’ perspectives, learn from their successes and failures, expand on the knowledge of their peers.

传记或是自传能成为程序员的灵感源泉，特别是那些追求创新的程序员。人类最重要的特点之一就是不必事事都亲力亲为，他们可以分析别人的观点，从他人的成功或失败中吸取教训，拓展自己的知识面。

A high number of inspirational figures are notable as true examples, which makes for great biographies. Among the recommendations:
他们的事迹造就了伟大的传记。以下是推荐：

“Steve Jobs” (by Walter Isaacson), the “official” biography of Apple’s founder. Walter Isaacson is a phenomenal biography writer, which probably explains why Jobs approached him.
“Steve Jobs” (作者：Walter Isaacson)，苹果创始人的“官方”传记。Walter Isaacson是一个成功的传记作家，这也是为什么乔布斯选择了他。

“Losing My Virginity” (an autobiography by Richard Branson). The founder of the Virgin group is a very interesting character, with a wonderful personality. Fans might also appreciate Branson’s other books, since he leaves his characteristic mark on all his work.
。。。。。。。。维珍集团创始人是一个有趣且高尚的人。粉丝们也喜爱布兰森的其他书，因为他把人格魅力留在了所有的工作中。

“Elon Musk” (by Ashlee Vance). The biography of the well-known innovator and entrepreneur is a must read for those who need inspiration. Elon Musk’s young-age hardship and his continuous strive to change the world will undoubtedly leave a mark on you.
“Elon Musk”（作者：Ashlee Vance）。著名创新者和企业家的传记对于需要灵感的人来说是必读的。伊隆·马斯克年轻时的艰辛和他不断努力改变世界无疑会给你留下深刻印象。

Bonus: “I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic” (by David Lagercrantz and Zlatan Ibrahimovic). Although this book doesn’t touch technology-related subjects, as do the other recommendations here, you will absolutely love this book if you are one of those “rock-star/ninja” programmers. Even if you’re on the shy and introverted side, you can learn about appreciating your self-worth from the one and only Zlatan.
附：“”（作者：）虽然这本书和其他推荐一样，没有涉及技术相关的主题，但如果你是那些“摇滚明星/忍者”程序员之一，你会绝对喜欢这本书。即使你性格害羞或内向，你一样可以从Zlatan身上学会欣赏你的自身价值。

Programming… well, programming books for programmers
编程嘛...好吧，给程序员的编程书

The most difficult part about reading a good technical book is choosing it. Many a times there’s intricate coursework and/or swamp-like text, which makes you dread ever starting reading on that subject. But once in a while, a really good technical book comes along. It makes the subject easy to understand and apply, it is easy to read and… we’ll probably call it “The [subject] Bible” at some point.
读技术书籍最难的部分在于如何选择。有时，晦涩难懂的课程或读起来像陷入沼泽般的文字，都会让你害怕去读。但是一旦开始阅读，你便能体会其中的奥妙。它让某个主题易于理解和应用，很容易就能读懂。我们通常称之为“某某圣经”。

A problematic issue with technical books (unfortunately not restricted to programming), is that many a times you can’t tell hype apart from quality. Therefore, remember to always read the reviews of a technical book, and consider the number of ratings as well. A good technical book should have a high number of readers and a high average review score. For a pleasant experience, choose wisely and only after much considerations. Or, why not, have a pick from our recommendations:
选择技术书籍有一个问题在于，你不会如何区分它出名是由于炒作还是自身质量。因此，记住要认真阅读一本技术书籍的评论，同时也考虑评分的数量（评论数）。好的技术书籍常常有着大量的读者和较高的分数。为了好好地读书，请三思而后选。或者也可以从我们的推荐中选取：

The Algorithms Bible: “Introduction to Algorithms” (by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein)
算法圣经：“”（作者：）
-The Artificial Intelligence Bible: “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach” (by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig). Often called AIMA, and part of many university curricula.
通常称为AIMA，是许多大学的课程用书之一。

The work ethics Bible: “The Clean Coder” (by Robert C. Martin). If I’d have to recommend just one book for programmers world-wide, I would recommend this book. It contains a lot of valuable information and tips for a balanced programming work life and true professionalism.
如果让我给全世界的程序员只推荐一本书，我会推荐这本。它包含了许多有价值的信息，同时平衡工作和生活的建议，还有真正的专业精神。


The Design Patterns Bible: “Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” (by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, also known as the Gang of Four or GoF).
The Enterprise Patterns Bible: “Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture” (by Martin Fowler et al.). This one in case the previous one already seems simple.

Social studies books for programmers
给程序员的社会学科学籍

It took me a while to come up with an umbrella term large enough to encompass psychology, economics, history and self-development. Recently there has a been an explosion of books in these subjects, but with simple, lay-person language. There are many resasons why these books are so popular, one of which is that you have the opportunity to learn about humans without going through the mistakes yourselves. As you might recall, I’ve said this before, with biographies. Now, it’s just the scale that differs. Here are our “gateway to social studies for programmers” picks:

“David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants” (by Malcolm Gladwell). This book argues that many of the things we consider disadvantages are in fact advantages. Gladwell’s writes in a very light and easy to understand tone, with lots of real-life examples. It is a must read for start-up owners!
“Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions” (by Dan Ariely). Reading this, you will get insight on how we make decisions, and how our rationality is sometimes not part of the equation.
“The Undercover Economist” (by Tim Harford). Do you think that each action (even the ones generally thought of as non-economics related) happen in isolation? Tim Harford will convince you of the opposite. In his economics-driven world, everything is interconnected in a game of strategy and negotiation. Game Theory aficionados will surely click with this book.
“The Third Chimpanzee” (by Jared Diamond). A book on the evolution of early humans, it goes into much detail regarding our societies, and the biological reasons of our behaviours. What I like most about Jared Diamond is his macro-view on things. Just like in his other book, “Guns, Germs and Steel”, another of my favourites, he does not go into irrelevant minor details, but rather has a very top-down approach of complex topics.
Science fiction books for programmers

Robert C. Martin (also known as “Uncle Bob”), one of the best-known software engineers and authors world-wide, stated in his book “The Clean Coder” that often he feels the need for creative input such as books and movies, to support his creative output of qualitative code. His personal preference? You guessed it. Science Fiction.

A good Science Fiction book makes you wonder. It makes you think about ethical dilemmas and future possibilities. It is also a subject that “sits well” with programmers, since future technology is something we often think about. I often feel defensive about this particular area of fiction, mostly because many people start off with “if it’s those robots things, I don’t like them”, while I generally enourage people to try a few times before they make up their mind. Some of the best Science Fiction books I’ve ever read are:

“The Naked Sun” (by Isaac Asimov). In fact, you can take up any of Asimov’s books and you’ll probably be satisfied.
“Ender’s Game” (by Orson Scott Card). A Harry Potter-esque story of a special boy, student in a space war academy, but with a very interesting twist at the end. Shhh, spoilers!
“The Old Man’s War” (by John Scalzi). Set in a future where old people can sign up for an interplanetary defense army, this book’s twist will blow your mind. Shall I give you a small hint? Well, you should firstly ask yourselves: “How can 75-year olds fight space wars?”
“1984” (by George Orwell). This is a classic. Actually, we might say this book invented the dystopia genre itself, with its bleak version of a future where every action is under complete surveillance. Not only is the premise interesting, but the narrative is great itself.
So what do you think? Let us know in the comments below if you think other genres need to be represented here. Have you read these books? Keep us posted with your progress and we would love to give you more recommendations in the future. Happy reading!
